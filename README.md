# PyTimerStopwatch
Python project that allows a user to run a stopwatch or timer in the terminal or with a GUI (eill evolve from just timer and stopwatch)
GUITimerStopwacth.py is the full extent and execution of this project and will be continually worked on until I am satisfied.
ConsoleTimerStopwatch.py was the test/beta version that I created when I was first beginning my Python journey and will not be updated anymore.
